- Handle all the mandatory flags and ensure intercompatibility

- Format the output depending on the flags (bonus = colours), if possible try to use snprintf to put everything into a buffer and then print it all at once rather than call printf multiple times (the less syscalls, the better).

- Final print should wrap dirnames that contain spaces with single quotes (e.g. 'My Folder')
